# It makes sense to me to define the web root as a volume at this time as we 
# have just installed the webserver which makes this directory significant. 
# However, doing so makes the directory unusable for derived docker images as 
# any further changes to it would be reverted to the state it was in when it was 
# first declaired a volume.
# 
# There is some debate over whether this behavior is a feature or a bug:
